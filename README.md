## Overview

This project is structured as a research framework for analyzing cross-platform
prediction market inefficiencies.

Core analytical components:

- **Execution Realism Module**
  - Models VWAP degradation
  - Quantifies slippage vs size
  - Detects partial fill risk

- **Edge Decomposition Engine**
  - Breaks raw spreads into:
    - VWAP-adjusted edge
    - Fee-adjusted edge
    - Latency-adjusted edge
  - Computes executable quantity
  - Evaluates scalability of opportunities

- **Edge Persistence (Half-Life) Module**
  - Measures how long executable edge persists over time per Opportunity_ID
  - Converts snapshot “live/not-live” states into contiguous opportunity events
  - Outputs event duration statistics (median duration as a half-life proxy)
  - Designed to run on continuous matched-pair snapshot logs (not included in this repo)
 
- **Portability Demo — Crypto Microstructure**

Demonstrates that the execution realism abstraction generalizes beyond
prediction markets.

- Applies VWAP walking logic to a continuous-price crypto-style L2 orderbook
- Reports slippage in basis points (bps)
- Analyzes nonlinear depth impact as trade size scales
- Detects partial fill conditions in symmetric orderbooks

This module's goal is to serve as a structural portability proof.

## Research Paper

A short research note accompanies this framework:

**"Execution-Constrained Arbitrage in Fragmented Markets"**

The paper ties together

- Depth-aware execution modeling
- Economic edge decomposition
- Liquidity ceilings
- Temporal decay of inefficiencies
- Cross-venue microstructure portability

The objective is to formalize the architectural reasoning behind my prediction market 
arb project.

## Running Analytical Demos

Execution realism:
python analysis/execution_realism_demo.py

Edge decomposition:
python analysis/edge_decomposition_demo.py

Edge persistence:
python analysis/spread_persistence_demo.py data/raw/your_snapshot_file.csv

Crypto portability:
python analysis/crypto_microstructure_demo.py

 *Data Note*
This demo does not include raw or derived market data. The persistence demo expects a continuous matched-pair snapshot CSV generated by the logging pipeline (e.g., `data/raw/...`). Outputs are written to `data/derived/`.
