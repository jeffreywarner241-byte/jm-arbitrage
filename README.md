## Overview

This project is structured as a research framework for analyzing cross-platform
prediction market inefficiencies.

Core analytical components:

- **Execution Realism Module**
  - Models VWAP degradation
  - Quantifies slippage vs size
  - Detects partial fill risk

- **Edge Decomposition Engine**
  - Breaks raw spreads into:
    - VWAP-adjusted edge
    - Fee-adjusted edge
    - Latency-adjusted edge
  - Computes executable quantity
  - Evaluates scalability of opportunities

- **Edge Persistence (Half-Life) Module**
  - Measures how long executable edge persists over time per Opportunity_ID
  - Converts snapshot “live/not-live” states into contiguous opportunity events
  - Outputs event duration statistics (median duration as a half-life proxy)
  - Designed to run on continuous matched-pair snapshot logs (not included in this repo)

## Running Analytical Demos

Execution realism:
python analysis/execution_realism_demo.py

Edge decomposition:
python analysis/edge_decomposition_demo.py

Edge persistence:
python analysis/spread_persistence_demo.py data/raw/your_snapshot_file.csv
 *Data Note*
This demo does not include raw or derived market data. The persistence demo expects a continuous matched-pair snapshot CSV generated by the logging pipeline (e.g., `data/raw/...`). Outputs are written to `data/derived/`.
